# 2nd-Order-Object-Simulator
Simple and not well written example of 2nd order pneumatic object simulator. 
User can easily see the waveforms of the pressure signal in the second tank. 
Project is a good theoretical example of how real life inertial objects work. 
User interface implements the functionality of setting the value of step signal. 
There is also a button responsible for simulating the step response of the object. 
There is also possibility to easily change the simulation object by modifying one response function.
